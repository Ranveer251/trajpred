DISCLAIMER
==========
Our code inside 'code/' is extended on Kothari et al.'s work and code and the folders are still named according to their work.
Any reference to a paper/github was originally in their work and does not belong to us. We have properly cited them in our paper as well and 
ensure that the guidelines of anonymity are being followed by us.

Our Dataset is present in code/trajnetplusplusbaselines-1/DATA_BLOCK/orcadata

HOW TO TRAIN THE MODELS (AUTOMATED)
===================================
$ cd code/scripts
$ bash setup.sh

There exist scripts to train and produce results for each of the models:
$ bash kothari.sh
$ bash ie.sh
$ bash ca.sh
$ bash caie.sh
$ bash res.sh

HOW TO GENERATE RESULTS FOR MODELS
==================================
For now, in OUTPUT_BLOCK for all models files are created with the same name.
TO generate predictions and results use the following:

Example for Kothari et al dataset:
$ python -m trajnetbaselines.lstm.trajnet_evaluator --output OUTPUT_BLOCK/trajdata/lstm_directional_None.pkl.epoch25 --path trajdata

OUR METRIC
==========
The code for our metric is present in 'our-metric/met.py'
You need to simply run this file:
$ python met.py

In the main fucntion, provide the location to the directory containing three folders: test, test_pred and test_private (as generated by the model while producing predictions)
A sample is already provided in the code for the predictions of all models in our paper on our dataset.
